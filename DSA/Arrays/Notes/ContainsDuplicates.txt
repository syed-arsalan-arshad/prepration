Problem: Contains Duplicate ✅
Difficulty: Easy
Pattern: Hash Set (for existence checking)

Approaches:
1. Brute Force: O(n²) time, O(1) space - nested loops
2. Object (Hash Table): O(n) time, O(n) space - JavaScript objects
3. Hash Set: O(n) time, O(n) space ← OPTIMAL (Set is most appropriate)

Key Insight: Store elements as you iterate, check if already exists. If exists, we found duplicate → return true
Template: Set/Map for O(1) existence checks vs O(n) array searching
